# Customer Segmentation Using Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on building a **Supervised Machine Learning Model** to segment customers based on behavioural data. Using a dataset of 300 customer records, the model identifies customer clusters to optimize marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

## Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, normalized the data, and prepared it for machine learning.
- **Model Creation:** Developed using classification algorithms to group customers into distinct segments.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model was evaluated based on its ability to accurately group customers, providing insights into behavioral patterns.
- **Real-World Application:** These insights can be applied to tailor marketing campaigns and improve business outcomes.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** for model development.
- **Scikit-learn** for classification algorithms.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data processing.
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing customer segments.

## Results:
The trained model revealed three distinct customer segments, each with unique purchasing behaviors, enabling the business to target personalized marketing efforts and increase customer retention.

## How to Run:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebook `customer_segmentation.ipynb` to view the data preprocessing, model building, and results.

## Future Improvements:
- Explore more complex models like **K-Means** or **Neural Networks** to improve accuracy.
- Collect more customer data to refine the segments.
